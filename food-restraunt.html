      <p class="information">Pa Pa Ya certainly sets itself apart in terms of decor, food, drinks and service. It really is the whole package. The seventy-foot high domed ceiling, beautiful elevated bar, lively vibe and quality ingredients make it one of our favourite Asian restaurants in Delhi.

    <div class="col-lg-6">
      <p class="information">What’s in the name? Everything. Named after the author of the Italian cookbook, The Science in the Kitchen and The Art of Eating Well, the essence of Artusi Ristorante E Bar lies in its the name. Artusi pays attention to tiny details that most restaurants ignore: From starched white tablecloths to the Italian wine list. The restaurant doesn’t have over the top decor, rather the entire energy is poured in serving its patrons superior quality, authentic Italian food. </p>

The restaurant lays emphasis on traditional Indian culinary ways. The menu that hasn’t been changed for years is presented on a wooden board and every dish it features is a masterpiece. The tikkas and kebabs are skillfully marinated in the finest of spices and then carefully char-grilled to perfection.</p>

Dum Pukht has been known for reviving India’s royal culinary traditions: From the courts of Awadh to Kashmir. They use the ancient method of dum-style of cooking. ‘Dum’ means to breathe in and ‘Pukht’ means to cook. This method of slow cooking renders a tender texture and a deep flavour to the meats.</p>

      <img src="saravana.jpg">
    </div>
    <div class="col-lg-6">
      <p class="information">Cast off your notion of Southern food being restricted to only idlis and dosas and visit Saravana Bhawan where the menu is overwhelmingly elaborate. It is ready at 8 A.M. every morning to serve you some feather-light appams and wholesome pongal for breakfast. You’ll often find people braving the queue outside this famous South Indian eatery. We love their Rava Dosa but it is their milky Mysore Pak that we go back for each time.</p>

    <div class="col-lg-6">
      <p class="information">Moti Mahal has been credited with inventing the creamy Butter Chicken curry.
